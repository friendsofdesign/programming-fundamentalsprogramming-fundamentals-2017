# Common Elements of Programming Languages

There are a number of universal elements that exist between all programming
languages. These elements are similar to the elements of HTML, in that, they
make up the pieces needed to successfully write code, like ids, classes, and
tags in HTML provide the backbone of a website structure and layout.

* **Variable:** Container which allow developers to store data.

* **Identifier:** Name assigned to a variable.*
  *\*Some words are keywords and are reserved, these will cause conflict with
  the language syntax.*

* **Expression:** ­A value, variable, combination of variables, operators
  (operands) and values that produce a result.

* **Operands:** ­The variables and values contained in the Expression.

* **Operators:** ­Symbols that denote the manipulation of operands. There are
  number of different types of operators.

  * **Arithmetic Operators:** ­These perform mathematical operations, addition,
    subtraction, etc.

  * **Assignment Operators:** ­These perform assignment of values to variables.
    i.e. `var myVariable = 5;`

  * **Comparison Operators:** ­These are used to compare and evaluate whether a
    value is greater than another. i.e. `5 > 3`

  * **Logical Operators:** ­Used to compare two or more boolean operands and test
    for equality. i.e. `!== 5` (not strictly equal to 5).

  * **Special Operators:** ­Special operators are part of the code syntax and are
    used to make the code understandable to the browser or PC.

* **Literal:** ­A fixed value, like a number or string. Sometimes called a
  "static" value.

* **Event:** ­An action performed by a user (click), or by the script or a set of
  criteria is met by the code or a variable's value, i.e. If my `day` variable
  is equal to 19 send a message saying "Happy Birthday" to the user.

* **Event Handler:** ­Code that executes in response to a particular Event.

* **Method:** ­A set of code written as an executable procedure defined on an
  object.

* **Function:** ­A set of code written as an executable procedure  not defined on
  an object.

* **Function Definition:** ­The code within the function that make up the
  procedure of the function.

* **Parameter:** ­A variable declared in a function definition. Passed into the a
  function’s parentheses.

* **Call:** ­Ask the browser/computer to execute a function or method.

* **Arguments:** ­Variables and values passed into a function’s parentheses.

* **Variable Scope:** ­Variables can be defined in two scopes, Global or Local.
  A global variable can be used in all parts of the code. Local variables can
  only be used within the function it was declared in.

* **Data Types:** ­A specific category of data that a variable can hold. There
  are five primitive types of data in JavaScript. Number, Boolean, String,
  Undefined, and Null.

* **Primitive Types:** ­Data that can only be assigned a single value.

* **Number:** ­Positive or negative numbers with or without decimal places or a
  number written in using exponential notation.

* **Boolean:** Logic value for true or false.

* **String:** ­Alphanumeric numbers and letters i.e. "This is a string of text"
  or "42".

* **Undefined:** A non­existent variable, or has no value or cannot resolve the
  expression.

* **Null:** ­An empty value.

* **Array:** ­A list of variables, objects or values, always beginning at 0.

* **Statements:** ­Commands that are used when the app or site code needs to make
  a decision. There are many statements that can be utilised when asking the
  system to make decisions based on values or events.

* **If Statement:** ­This is conditional statement to check if the arguments
  provided evaluate as true.

* **If Else Statement:** ­If the conditional statement does not evaluate to true,
  do something else. This can also be nested in an IF statement.

* **Switch Statement:** ­Allows a developer to execute a particular set of
  statements based on value of a specific expression.

* **While Statement:** ­This is a loop statement, it will repeat a series of
  statements as long as the conditions of the expression is met.

* **Do While Statement:** ­This is another loop statement, it will execute a
  statement or series of statements once, then repeat as long as the condition
  is met.

* **For Statement:** ­Also known as "for loop", this is used to repeat a series
  of statements as long as the conditional expression evaluates to true.
